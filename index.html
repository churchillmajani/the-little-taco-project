                <em> Churchill Majani</em> is the founding father of The Little Taco shop.He was born in 1985 in a <em>middle class family</em>.He however always dreamed of starting a business and nurturing it till it gained International Status.After brainstorming,He came up with the idea of starting a Taco business as it was not yet established in Kenya.It was difficult at the beginning but <em> through sheer hardwork and good judgements</em>,the business boomed to the point he could not run it alone.Coupling this with the growing demand,He had to employ others for help and thus <em>created job opportunities</em>.It has thus grown over the years and attained theem <em> International status</em>.We thus hope that you will join us and enjoy the life-changing tacos

                    <p>
                        The taco as we know it today is a blend of ancient Mexican recipes and International influences. However, before it was known in America, natives in Mexico were eating a version that looked quite different.

                        Where did America’s favorite comfort food originate? Here’s the history of one of the best foods on the planet.
                        
                        Tacos are thought to come from Mexico, long before the Spanish arrived. Ancient Mexicans used freshly made, soft, flat corn tortillas and gave them with fillings like fish and cooked organs. It was a staple meal that provided vital nutrients and energy to those who consumed it.
                        
                        These tacos didn’t contain the cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and tomato that we associate with the meal today. In fact, the taco as we know it is less than 100 years old.
