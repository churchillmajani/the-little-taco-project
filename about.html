    <h1>CHURCHILL MAJANI BIO</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
<strong>Churchill Majani</strong> is the founding father of The Little Taco shop.He was born in 1985 in a middle class family.He however always dreamed of starting a business and nurturing it till it gained International Status.After brainstorming,He came up with the idea of starting a Taco business as it was not yet established in Kenya.It was difficult at the beginning but through <em>sheer hardwork and good judgements</em>,the business boomed to the point he could not run it alone.Coupling this with the growing demand,He had to employ others for help and thus <em>created job opportunities</em>.It has thus grown over the years and attained the International status.We thus hope that you will join us and enjoy the <em>life-changing tacos</em>
